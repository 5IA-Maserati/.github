# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Our projects are actively maintained by the 5IA-Maserati organization.  
Security updates are provided on a best-effort basis for the latest versions of each repository.

If a repository is no longer maintained, it will be clearly indicated in its README.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability in any 5IA-Maserati project, please send a detailed report to the 5IA Security Team.

When reporting, please include:
- A clear description of the issue  
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability  
- The potential impact  
- Any proof-of-concept code or screenshots  
- Suggested fixes (optional)

We take security issues seriously and will respond as quickly as possible.

## Handling Process
1. We confirm the receipt of the vulnerability report.  
2. The maintainers investigate and evaluate severity.  
3. A fix is developed in a private branch if necessary.  
4. A patch is released, along with an advisory (if appropriate).  
5. The reporter may be credited, unless anonymity is requested.

## Security Best Practices for Contributors
To help keep our projects secure, we ask contributors to:
- Avoid committing sensitive data (passwords, tokens, private keys, etc.)  
- Follow secure coding practices  
- Review pull requests carefully for potential vulnerabilities  
- Report suspicious or risky behavior immediately  

## Responsible Disclosure
We ask that security vulnerabilities be reported privately first, and not publicly disclosed until an appropriate fix has been released and verified.

Thank you for helping keep our community safe!
